In order to build dvisvgm for MiKTeX with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 you
need to download the source code archives of the following libraries
which are not bundled with the dvisvgm sources:

FreeType:   https://freetype.org
zlib:       http://zlib.net

If you want to build dvisvgm with ttfautohint support, the related
development files as well as the ttfautohint DLL are needed. They are
available from https://github.com/mgieseki/ttfautohint-dll.

Extract the contents of the usually versioned root folders present in the
library archives to the corresponding subfolders in the "vc" directory, e.g.
the contents of zlib-1.2.11, should go to vc\zlib.

Now open the Visual Studio IDE, load dvisvgm.sln, and start the build process.

Alternatively, you can trigger the build process on the command-line with
  msbuild /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=<platform> dvisvgm.sln
where <platform> is either "win32" or "x64" for the 32- and 64-bit binaries,
respectively.
